# Locally vs. in the cloud - What's the difference

Basically summed down to this:
<h1><u>Cloud</u></h1>
**Pros**
- Fast and Reliable (generally)
- Scalable
- (can be) Cost-effective
- Access to Pre-trained Proprietary Models
- Vendor Makes service Easy to use
**Cons**
- Can get expensive from over-usage
- Closed source and proprietary
- Vendor Lock-In
- Model Providers can use your chats to train their models (Less private)
- Requires Wi-Fi
- Bad for the environment due to extremely high power consumption

<h1><u>Local</u></h1>
**Pros
- More control
- Low costs
- Excellent Privacy
- Can be run offline
- Less power consumption/Less environmental impact
**Cons
- High costs upfront for a competent rig
- Can be difficult to set up.
- Limited Scalability
- Can't access pre-trained proprietary models like (GPT-5)
- Speed is heavily dependent on rig specs
