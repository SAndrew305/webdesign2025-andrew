<h1 align="center">Vibe Code Cleaning</h1>

Put cleaned up code here. NO CSS, NO CONFUSING DIVS AND PARAGRAPHS, JUST A SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE WEBPAGE. 
<br><br>
If using Javascript, are the variables sensibly named using camelCase, "myVar" etc? don't use promises (.then) instead use async/await, 
no addEventListeners unless completely necessary, and get an LLM to make the changes. MORE changes.
Only simple JS, nothing fancy.
