<h1 align="center">Vibe Code Cleaning</h1>

Put cleaned up code here. NO CSS, NO CONFUSING DIVS AND PARAGRAPHS, JUST A SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE WEBPAGE.

If using Javascript, are the variables sensibly named using camelCase, "myVar" etc? don't use promises (.then) instead use async/await, 
no addEventListeners unless completely necessary, and get an LLM to make the changes. MORE changes.
Only simple JS, nothing fancy.

Final comments: Any observations about your code compared to the original Vibe code? <br>
The cleaned code is much more organized and easier to read. Variables are named more sensibly using camelCase, making it clear what each variable represents. The game logic is structured in a way that separates concerns, with distinct functions for updating game state, drawing elements, and handling user input. The removal of unnecessary event listeners and the use of a single input handler simplifies the interaction model. Overall, the cleaned code is more maintainable and efficient, adhering to best practices in JavaScript programming.
In layman's terms, it just works.
