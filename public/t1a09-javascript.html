<h1>t1a09 - Javascript</h1>
<h2>A (very) brief history of Javascript</h2>
Javascript was created in 1995 in one week by programmer Brendan Eich, with the goal of adding in an easy-to-learm scripting language to the Netscape internet browser.
It's original name was called Mocha, but the rise of Java prompted the marketing team to rename it Javascript to hopefully capitalize on the Java community,
despite it having little to no relation to Java whatsoever.
