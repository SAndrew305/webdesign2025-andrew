As per request, three images have been made. And seeing how one of those images is our background, here are two GIFs.
<br>
<img src="images/crapp.gif" alt="Gif 1" width="250"></img>
<img src="images/Strobing.gif" alt="Gif 1" width="250" style="opacity:1;"></img>
<br>
And as per my vague understanding, I have forgotten how to have it so that even with multiple figures, all other elements maintain their opacity. But thats three. You're welcome
