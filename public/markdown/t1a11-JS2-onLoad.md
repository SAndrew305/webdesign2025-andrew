The `onload` event occurs when an object has been loaded.

onload is most often used within the `<body>` element to execute a script once a web page has completely loaded all content (including images, script files, CSS files, etc.).

The `onload` event can be used to check the visitor's browser type and browser version, and load the proper version of the web page based on the information.

The `onload` event can also be used to deal with cookies.
