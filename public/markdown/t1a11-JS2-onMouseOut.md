The `onmouseout` event occurs when the mouse **pointer moves out of an element**.

The `onmouseout` event is often used together with the [`onmouseover`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onmouseover.asp) event, which occurs when the pointer is moved over an element.

The`onmouseout` event is similar to the [`onmouseleave`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onmouseleave.asp) event. The difference is that the `onmouseleave` event does not bubble (does not propagate up the document hierarchy).
