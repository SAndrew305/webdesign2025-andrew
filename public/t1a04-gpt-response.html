RESPONSE:

To get information from people, you use a form. A form is just a set of questions or boxes for people to fill in.

The Basic Form Tag

First, everything goes inside a <form> tag. This tells the computer, "Hey, all this stuff is part of one big question sheet!"
HTML

<form>
  </form>

All The Form Fun!

Let's add all the different types of questions you can ask.

1. Text Box

Single-line box for short answers like your name.

HTML

<label>What's your name?</label><br>
<input type="text">

    <label> is the question you're asking.

    <input type="text"> creates the little box to type in.

2. Password Box

Like a text box, but it obstructs what you type with ‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè.

HTML

<label>What's your secret password?</label><br>
<input type="password">

3. Text Area: For Long Stories

If you want to write a whole story, you need a bigger box. That's a <textarea>.

Code:
HTML

<label>Tell us something cool about yourself:</label><br>
<textarea></textarea>

4. Radio Buttons

Use these when you can only choose one option.

Code:
HTML

<label>What's your favorite season?</label><br>
<input type="radio" name="season"> Summer <br>
<input type="radio" name="season"> Winter <br>
<input type="radio" name="season"> Spring

    Because they all share the same name, only one can be selected at a time.
5. Checkboxes: Pick As Many As You Want!

Use checkboxes to choose more than one thing.

HTML

<label>Which pizza toppings do you like?</label><br>
<input type="checkbox"> Pepperoni <br>
<input type="checkbox"> Mushrooms <br>
<input type="checkbox"> Extra Cheese

6. Dropdown Menu: A Tidy List

This is a neat list of options that appears when you click it. It saves space!


HTML
  <label>What's your favorite animal?</label><br>
  <select>
    <option>Dog</option>
    <option>Cat</option>
    <option>Dinosaur</option>
  </select>

7. Submit Button: All Done!

This is the big button at the end. When you click it, it "sends" all your answers. For now, it won't actually send them anywhere, but it's an important part of any form!

HTML
<input type="submit" value="Send My Answers!">

    The value is what the button says on it.
