Having done nothing like this before, I felt like this was going to be a very difficult time for me, until I realized that with Google, a 5 minute YouTube video and a shred of
an idea as to what the heck I'm doing, I could do this.<br>
<br>
The experience was, interesting. I built a simple LED circuit board as shown below, using parts I
saw from the tutorial, because, as I mentioned before, I'm not great at this. But I got it done!

I will say the interface can be a bit confusing for someone jumping into this for the first time,
so personally, I recommend learning a bit more before trying to make your own PCB.
