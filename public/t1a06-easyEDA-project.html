I've never done something like this before,
So here's what I did. <br>
I hopped on the program, and I made a new project, and I watched a video. <br>
<img src="images/t1a06-easyEDA-1.png" alt="easyEDA-1"><br>
And surprisingly, I made something.
The experience was confusing, and it still is, but that's because I still have a long way to go with this.
