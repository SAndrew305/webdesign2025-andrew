# Different Types of Generative AI

**GPT's, LLM's, AND LM's ARE NOT THE SAME THING. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM.**

LM (Language Model) - A model of the human brain's ability to produce natural language.

LLM (Large Language Model) - A language model trained with self-supervised machine learning on a large amount of text, designed for language processing tasks, including language generation.

GPT - Generative Pre-trained Transformer. A type of LLM widely used in chatbots. Trained on large datasets of unlabeled content.

DBIG (Diffusion-Based Image Generators) 
	T2I (Text to Image) - ML Model which takes an input in the form of a natural language prompt and attempts to produce a image matching that description.

	T2V (Text to Video) - ML Model which takes an input in the form of a natural language prompt and attempts to produce a video matching that description.
